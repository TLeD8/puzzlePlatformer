This game was developed entirely remotely in a team of 4 and we started this to demonstrate our commitment to working in a team to solve problems, and how we can apply new software development methodologies to guide our work process. The result is a fun game with challenging puzzles and endless replay value.

## How to play:
1. To play the game, download the ZIP file or clone this repo to your local computer
2. run  `javac src/PP.java` and `java src/PP.java`
3. Use WASD to control your character and space to jump. Enjoy!
